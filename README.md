Responsive Navbar Using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

A navbar, short for "navigation bar," is a graphical user interface element used to provide links and navigation to different pages or sections of a website. It typically appears at the top of a webpage and can be fixed, meaning it stays in place as the user scrolls, or static, meaning it scrolls with the page. A well-designed navbar should be easy to use, with clear and descriptive labels, and help users quickly find what they are looking for on a website. It can be created using HTML and styled with CSS to fit the overall design and branding of a website.
